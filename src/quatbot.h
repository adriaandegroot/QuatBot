/** @brief Top-level class for the QuatBot
 * 
 * The bot is basically self-managing. Once you have a connection
 * to the Matrix server that has reached the *connected* state,
 * create one Bot object per room to follow.
 * 
 * The bot has a collection of *Watchers* that handle messages in the
 * room. Only regular text messages are tracked, and no redaction or
 * anything is done. The watchers handle each incoming message, **and**
 * if the message starts with the special command-prefix (~, by default)
 * then the message is considered a command and is processed by one
 * Watcher (which one, depends on the command).
 * 
 * The bot keeps track of a list of *operators* for the room. These
 * operators can perform administrative operations on the bot,
 * such as adding more operators, switching on logging, and
 * running meetings (the full scope depends on the modules
 * (Watcher instances) that run in the bot).
